# Comment Copilot Backend

### Overview

Comment Copilot is designed to elevate the quality of user comments on news stories by
leveraging the power of GPT-4. Our goal is to assist users in crafting in-depth, unique,
and thoughtful comments that contribute meaningfully to the discussion.

### How It Works

1. **Input**: The user submits a comment related to a news story.
2. **Articulation**: GPT-4 processes the comment to understand its context and content and
   articulates it fully.
3. **Assessment**: The model evaluates whether the comment could benefit from additional
   details or clarification, and whether there are other similar comments already.
4. **Follow-up**: If needed, GPT-4 will ask the user a follow-up question to rectify any
   misunderstandings, distinguish the comment from other similar comments, or to add
   more depth to comment.
5. **Confirmation**: Once GPT-4 is satisfied with the quality of the comment, it is sent back
   to the user for final approval, or any updates.

### Problems Comment Copilot solves

1. **Lack of depth**: Users often post comments that are too short or lack depth, leading
   to a lack of substance in the discussion.
2. **Lack of originality**: Users often post comments that are similar to other comments
   already posted, leading to an appearance of a lack of diversity in the discussion due
   to missing nuance.
3. **Vagueness**: Comments that are too vague or ambiguous can be misinterpreted by
   other users, leading to misunderstandings and arguments.
4. **Misunderstandings**: Users often misunderstand the context of the story or the
   comment, leading to misinterpretations and arguments.
